# Post-Quantum Cryptography & Principal Quantum Analysis

## Description

This project explores **Post-Quantum Cryptography** (PQC) and **Principal Quantum Analysis** (PQA) methods, applying **Linear Algebra (LA)** concepts to analyze a **Diabetic Dataset**. The project aims to evaluate the implications of quantum computing on cryptography and data analysis, specifically in the context of healthcare.

### Key Areas of Focus:
1. **Post-Quantum Cryptography**: 
   - Analysis of current cryptographic methods and their vulnerability to quantum computing.
   - Exploration of quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms.
   
2. **Principal Quantum Analysis (PQA)**: 
   - Application of quantum computing techniques in analyzing large datasets.
   - Use of Linear Algebra concepts, such as **quantum matrices** and **superposition**, to enhance data analysis.

3. **Diabetic Dataset**: 
   - The dataset includes patient records with various health metrics like glucose levels, age, BMI, etc.
   - The goal is to use quantum analysis to uncover hidden patterns and optimize prediction models for diabetes diagnosis.
